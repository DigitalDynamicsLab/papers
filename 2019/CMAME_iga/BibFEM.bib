abstract = "This paper presents a displacement-based and a mixed isogeometric collocation formulations for three-dimensional geometrically exact shear-deformable beams with arbitrarily curved initial geometry. Strong forms of both formulations are consistently linearized with respect to the underlying configuration manifold. High efficiency is achieved by using a geometrically consistent kinematic model in which incremental rotations are parametrized through the spatial rotation vector. Several numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed mixed formulation is totally locking-free for any choice of approximation degree. Mixed formulation also exhibits higher robustness in the incremental-iterative algorithm. Elimination of shear locking and low computational cost assured by the combination of isogeometric collocation with a consistent kinematic model result in a very efficient, accurate and geometrically powerful method able to handle geometrically complex beam problems."

abstract = "A frictionless contact formulation for spatial rods is developed within the framework of isogeometric collocation. The structural mechanics is described by the Cosserat theory of geometrically nonlinear spatial rods. The numerical discretization is based on an isogeometric collocation method, where the geometry and solution fields are represented as NURBS curves and the strong forms of the equilibrium equations are collocated at Greville points. In this framework, a frictionless rod-to-rod contact formulation is proposed. Contact points are detected by a coarse-level and a refined search for close centerline points and reaction forces are computed by the actual penetration of rod surface points, so that the enforcement of the contact constraints is performed with the penalty method. An important aspect is the application of contact penalty forces as point loads within the collocation scheme, and methods for this purpose are proposed and evaluated. The overall contact algorithm is validated by and applied to several numerical examples."

The model is based on Cosserat rod theory that incorporates shear, elongation, flexure and twist deformations. The problem of avoiding self-penetration of parts of the rod is handled by the introduction of a contact distance function and the incorporation of associated contact forces. We present a penalty method for the treatment of the multi-valued and non-differentiable contact law. We also describe an augmented Lagrangian formulation of this problem. We then give the details of the finite-element discretization of the elastic rod self-contact problem as well as some numerical examples."
