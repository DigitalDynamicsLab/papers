  abstract = {Aiming at a fast and robust simulation of large multibody systems
	with contacts and friction, this work presents a novel method for
	solving large cone complementarity problems by means of a fixed-point
	iteration. The method is an extension of the Gauss-Seidel and Gauss-Jacobi
	method with overrelaxation for symmetric convex linear complementarity
	problems. The method is proved to be convergent under fairly standard
	assumptions and is shown by our tests to scale well up to 500,000
	contact points and more than two millions of unknowns.},
